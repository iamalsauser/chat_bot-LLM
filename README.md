# chat_bot-LLM
This code is an implementation of a simple chatbot using TensorFlow, a machine learning framework developed by Google. The chatbot is trained using a neural network to classify user inputs into predefined intents and provide appropriate responses based on the detected intent. The `intents.json` file contains the data that we will provide to our chatbot. This project serves as an introduction to GenAI and simple LLM (Large Language Model) inference on CPU, as well as the fine-tuning of an LLM model to create a custom chatbot. By leveraging these advanced techniques, the chatbot can be tailored to specific requirements and provide more accurate and contextually relevant interactions with users.
